This is my group's code for NUS Lifehack 2022

Telegram Bot Name: @SaveTheEarthbot (https://t.me/SaveTheEarthbot)

Our ideal solution is to use a Telegram Bot for pre-ordering of food in canteen stalls starting from schools. Users can key in their choice of canteen, specific stalls, and preorder their desired food whenever they want, and submit their order to the vendors. The vendors will be informed in advance how much food to prepare for a particular day and avoid cooking too much food which is wasted eventually. A 30-minute collection time slot is allocated based on users' choice of time to minimize crowd levels when picking up their orders. 

The Bot features a coin system for discounts for orders within the bot. This incentivizes users to use the bot more frequently and more accurate data can be given to food vendors on how much to cook, hence minimizing food waste. Canceling the order multiple times will result in the deduction of coins. These facilitate the bot's main functionality which is to reduce food wastage from the vendors' side. Additionally, the recent news from the Singapore governement (in 2022)  on the revision of school canteen food costs means it is time for the bot to be launched to offset the rising cost of food.
